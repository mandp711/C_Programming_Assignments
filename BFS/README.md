List.h:
    Description: Header file that contains the declarations and structure definitions for the List Abstract Data Type (ADT). It outlines the function prototypes and types necessary for list manipulation.

List.c:
    Description: Source file that implements the List ADT as defined in List.h. It includes the actual function definitions to manage and manipulate the doubly linked list.

Graph.h:
    Description: Header file that contains the structure and function prototypes for the Graph ADT. It declares the necessary components for representing a graph and its operations, like adding edges and performing BFS.

Graph.c:
    Description: Source file that implements the Graph ADT functions defined in Graph.h. It includes operations such as adding edges, performing breadth-first search (BFS), and retrieving shortest paths.

GraphTest.c:
    Description: Test client that verifies the correctness of the Graph ADT implementation. It includes various test cases for checking graph construction, edge addition, and BFS functionality.

FindPath.c:
    Description: The main program that reads graph data from an input file, builds a graph, performs breadth-first search (BFS), and computes shortest paths between vertex pairs. The results are printed to an output file.

Makefile:
    Description: Compilation script that automates the build process. It defines instructions for compiling the project, running tests, and cleaning up generated files. It includes targets for each component of the project.

README.md:
    Description: A brief document that summarizes the project, explaining the purpose of each file, how to compile and run the code, and any special notes for understanding or using the program.
